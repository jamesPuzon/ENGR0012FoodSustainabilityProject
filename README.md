Food Sustainability Project

Problem Statement:

Addressing both the water quantity and water quality issues around the world is a GLOBAL GRAND CHALLENGE. 
There are many communities and countries who would like to improve Food Sustainability ( nutrition, agriculture, waste etc). 
You have been tasked with designing a software program (i.e. code) that can help increase processes or products for Food Sustainability.

Your goal in this project is to design a software program to help improve Food sustainability:

1. You must choose a specific client/type of customer and a specific setting to design your program around Food Sustainability.
The more specific your client is (i.e. students, engineers, parents, kids, educators, operators) and the more focused your setting
(i.e. Farming, Transportation, Manufacturing, Ordering, Containers, Food Waste, Composting) the more detailed you will be able to be in your code.

2. This is a very open-ended problem and there are no single solutions. You can approach your solution any way you'd like, it is up to you!
I would strongly suggest that you sit together as a team and generate ideas (as you did last year) for all types of programs that you might make.
